# Sockent.js package
Event based Socket.io wrapper for Node.js.

This package wraps basic functionalities of the Socket.io package in very easy to use classes. It drastically limits what you can do but allows rapid prototyping. Also might be useful if you don't want to learn about sockets too much but want to create basic app quickly.

Github [Repository](https://github.com/Jakub21/Sockent.js)

### Get the package
There is shrinked single-file version in the repo's releases tab.

I'm considering uploading to NPM when package is closer to complete.

### Usage
You can find simple server + client example in `example` directory.

To run it put `Sockent.js` file from the latest release in `example` directory.
Run `node Server.js` and then `node Client.js` in another terminal.
