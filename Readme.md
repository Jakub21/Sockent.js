# Sockevt.js package
Event based Socket.io wrapper for Node.js.

This package wraps basic functionalities of the Socket.io package in very easy to use classes. It drastically limits what you can do but allows rapid prototyping. Also might be useful if you don't want to learn about sockets too much but want to create basic app quickly.
